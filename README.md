Here’s a clean, **GitHub-formatted README** with proper Markdown syntax — looks sharp, readable, and professional while still noting it’s a school project:

# 🌌 OOP Solar System Simulation

An **object-oriented 2D solar system simulation** built in **Processing** for a **school project**.
This simulation models **gravitational interactions**, **orbital motion**, and **collisions** between celestial bodies — demonstrating key **OOP principles**, physics logic, and scalable simulation design.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🌍 **Realistic orbital motion** and gravitational pull
* ☄️ **Collision detection and fusion logic** for asteroids and planets
* 🔭 **Auto-scaling camera** that keeps all objects in frame
* 🪐 **Customizable scenarios** (e.g., solar system, binary stars, supernova events)
* 🧩 **Fully object-oriented structure** for modular and extensible code

## 🧠 Project Structure

```
/OOP-Solar-System
│
├── Celestial.java       # Base class for all celestial objects
├── Planet.java          # Defines planet-specific behavior
├── Asteroid.java        # Handles collision and fusion logic
├── Scenario.java        # Manages different system configurations
└── Simulation.pde       # Main Processing sketch (entry point)
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Install **[Processing](https://processing.org/download/)**.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OOP-Solar-System.git
   ```
3. Open `Simulation.pde` in Processing.
4. Click **Run ▶️** to start the simulation.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

* Add new bodies by creating subclasses of `Celestial`.
* Modify parameters like **mass**, **velocity**, or **position**.
* Adjust camera padding and time steps in `autoScaleCamera()` for smoother zooming.
* Experiment with `Scenario.java` to create unique systems.

---

## 📘 Notes

* Created for a **school project** to demonstrate **object-oriented programming** and **basic physics simulation**.
* Physics are simplified for visualization and learning purposes.
* Free to modify, fork, and expand upon.

Would you like me to include a **preview image or GIF section** (e.g., “Example Output” with a screenshot placeholder)? That instantly makes a GitHub page look more professional.
