# celestialSimulatorSchool
An object-oriented 2D solar system simulation built in Processing for a school project. Models gravitational interactions, orbital motion, and collisions between celestial bodies. Designed to demonstrate OOP principles, physics simulations, and flexible scenario setups for educational purposes

OOP Solar System Simulation

A basic object-oriented simulation of celestial dynamics using Processing. This project explores gravitational interactions, orbital mechanics, and simple collisions in a 2D space.

Features

Simulates a solar system with multiple celestial bodies (planets, asteroids, stars).

Implements object-oriented design for flexible, extendable structure.

Tracks motion, collisions, and interactions between bodies.

Auto-scaling camera to keep all objects in view.

Adjustable parameters for mass, velocity, and position.

Project Structure

Celestial.java – Base class for all celestial objects.

Planet.java – Planet-specific behavior and properties.

Asteroid.java – Asteroids with collision detection and fusion logic.

Simulation.pde – Main Processing sketch that runs the simulation.

Scenario.java – Handles different predefined scenarios (e.g., solar system, binary stars).
